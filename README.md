Project Overview
This project is a clock-based alarm application that allows users to set alarms at their desired times. A notable feature of this project is its utilization of the local storage in your browser. This means that if you accidentally close the tab or the entire window, the alarm you set will not be lost. Upon revisiting the page, you will find it exactly as you left it. Additionally, the application also remembers the last time you set an alarm.

Installation
The installation process is straightforward. Simply download the zip file and run a live server to get started.
